//! Static lint and validation support for SQL-on-FHIR ViewDefinitions.
//!
//! This crate adapts the FHIR schema (via `octofhir-fhirschema` and
//! `octofhir-canonical-manager`) into the analysis engine's
//! [`banshee_hir::SchemaProvider`] contract, so that generated SQL can be
//! validated against the real shape of a resource: which JSONB fields exist at
//! each path and whether they are arrays.
//!
//! The provider is the schema source for the FHIR lint pack. It is offline once
//! the FHIR package is present in the canonical-manager store.
